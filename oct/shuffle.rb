# Prompt: Write a function that takes an array of numbers, and randomly shuffles their order.
# Make sure that your algorithm is unbiased (ie. completely random), and that it remains
# random even as the input size of the array grows.

# If you're struggling, try looking up Fisher-Yates shuffle
# Example: shuffle([1,2,3,4,5,6]); // [3,6,1,2,5,4]
